# Vericreds Combined Repo

## Overview
`Vericreds` is a Web3 Proof of Concept (PoC) application developed during a hackathon, designed for cloud-based document sharing. It represents an integration of frontend and backend technologies in a single repository, highlighting a full-stack development approach with a focus on blockchain and modern web solutions.

## Frontend Technologies and Libraries
The frontend is built with React and Next.js, leveraging a range of libraries for enhanced functionality:
- **React & Next.js**: For building user interfaces and server-side rendering.
- **Redux Toolkit & React Redux**: State management.
- **Tailwind CSS & Framer Motion**: Styling and animations.
- **Ethers & Moralis**: Interacting with Ethereum blockchain.
- **Web3 Modal & Next Auth**: Web3 integrations and authentication.
- **Axios & React Dropzone**: HTTP requests and file uploading.
- **React Google ReCAPTCHA**: Enhancing security.

## Backend Technologies and Libraries
The backend is developed using Python with the following key libraries:
- **FastAPI & Flask**: Powerful web frameworks for building APIs.
- **Cerberus**: A lightweight and extensible data validation library.
- **Flask-CORS**: Handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for Flask applications.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type hinting.
- **PDF2Image**: Converting PDF files to images.
- **PyJWT**: Handling JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
- **PyMongo**: MongoDB driver for Python.
- **Python-Dotenv**: Loading environment variables from `.env` files.

## Purpose
Developed as a hackathon project, `Vericreds` demonstrates rapid and innovative full-stack development, integrating blockchain technology with a dynamic web frontend and robust backend services, tailored for cloud-based document sharing.
